CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Missing Python dependencies (multidict, aiosignal, attrs, frozenlist, yarl) were installed to fix 'No module named multidict' errors that were preventing geo/fraud services from working. BACKEND LOGS: No critical errors detected after dependency fix, all endpoints returning 200 status codes, geo and fraud services now functioning correctly. SUCCESS RATE: 4/4 tests passed (100%). ALL RUSSIAN USER REQUIREMENTS VERIFIED WORKING CORRECTLY."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE: The import modal has an automatic closure mechanism (likely setTimeout in lines 177-179 of UnifiedImportModal.js) that conflicts with the Russian user's requirement for persistent modal display. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Remove or modify the automatic modal closure behavior to keep the modal open after import completion, allowing users to review results and perform additional imports."

DETAILED VERIFICATION RESULTS: 1) ‚úÖ MANUAL SPEED TEST SINGLE NODE: Successfully tested speed on ping_ok/speed_ok nodes, all tests returned success=true, download_mbps and upload_mbps are NOT zero (real data confirmed), method is either 'speedtest_cli_real' or 'improved_throughput_test' or 'accurate_throughput_test' 2) ‚úÖ NO FAKE DATA VERIFICATION: Ran speed test twice on same node, results are slightly different proving real measurement (not fake random.uniform), no fake patterns detected (250.0, 150.0, 75.0, etc.), results vary between tests confirming real TCP measurements 3) ‚úÖ BATCH TESTING: Successfully tested 5+ nodes simultaneously, no std::logic_error failures detected, concurrency limit working correctly (max 1 concurrent as per review), system stable under concurrent testing 4) ‚úÖ REPORT DISPLAY FIELDS: All required fields present in speed_result (download/download_mbps, upload/upload_mbps, method, success), field types validated (numbers for speeds), UI can display results properly 5) ‚úÖ FALLBACK STRATEGY VERIFICATION: Fallback strategy working correctly (Speedtest CLI -> TCP measurement), method field correctly indicates which measurement method was used, system gracefully handles Speedtest CLI failures on ARM64. SUCCESS RATE: 5/5 tests passed (100%). CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS: Speed tests return REAL data (not fake random.uniform), no std::logic_error failures, fallback strategy working perfectly, results displayable in UI, system stable under concurrent testing. All user requirements for Speed OK functionality with real data successfully verified and working."

PROBLEM ANALYSIS: 1) useEffect triggers loadNodes()+loadStats() on every filter change without debouncing, 2) Full object dependency causes unnecessary re-renders, 3) /nodes/all-ids endpoint performs unoptimized ILIKE operations, 4) Missing database indexes for frequently filtered columns. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Added 300ms debouncing for filter changes using setTimeout, 2) Implemented useMemo for activeFilters to prevent unnecessary re-renders, 3) Used useCallback for loadNodes() and loadStats() with proper dependencies, 4) Added database indexes for provider, country, state, city, zipcode, login, protocol, status columns, 5) Optimized query logic with helper function apply_node_filters() for better performance, 6) Fixed duplicate @api_router.get('/nodes') decorator that was causing API errors.

MINOR LIMITATION: Progress display depends on having nodes to test - when import results in 0 new nodes (all duplicates), no progress bar appears as expected. All core functionality working as designed for Russian user requirements."

FIXES IMPLEMENTED: 1) Replaced network_tester.ping_test with test_node_ping for proper PPTP port 1723 testing, 2) Fixed speed test to use test_node_speed with proper IP address, 3) Added comprehensive error handling with immediate db.commit() after each test phase to prevent data loss, 4) Added timeout and exception recovery that reverts nodes to original status instead of leaving them stuck, 5) Added cleanup logic for any nodes stuck in 'checking' status at the end of import, 6) Enhanced logging to track all test phases.
