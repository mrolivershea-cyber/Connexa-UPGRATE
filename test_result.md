# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FIXED: Added explicit timestamp updates to: 1) POST /api/nodes (line 315), 2) process_parsed_nodes for add/replace (lines 1332, 1355), 3) Import testing (lines 398-421), 4) Manual ping test (lines 2061, 2075, 2090), 5) Manual speed test (lines 2131, 2151, 2167), 6) Manual launch services (lines 2218, 2239, 2254, 2264, 2277), 7) /test/ping (lines 1675, 1684, 1698), 8) /test/combined (lines 1793, 1807, 1820), 9) /nodes/auto-test (lines 1844, 1880, 1891), 10) /nodes/{id}/test (lines 1915, 1946, 1963), 11) /nodes/{id}/services/start (line 1992), 12) /nodes/{id}/services/stop (line 2035), 13) /services/start bulk (lines 1564, 1576, 1587), 14) /services/stop bulk (line 1622).

CORE API TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Manual Ping Test API (POST /api/manual/ping-test) - correctly validates not_tested status, rejects wrong status nodes, performs ping tests and transitions to ping_ok/ping_failed ✅ Manual Speed Test API (POST /api/manual/speed-test) - correctly validates ping_ok status, rejects wrong status nodes, performs speed tests and transitions to speed_ok/ping_failed ✅ Manual Launch Services API (POST /api/manual/launch-services) - correctly validates speed_ok status, rejects wrong status nodes, generates SOCKS credentials and OVPN configs, transitions to online/offline ✅ Error Handling - all 3 APIs correctly handle invalid node IDs and empty requests with proper error messages ✅ Database Schema - SOCKS fields (socks_ip, socks_port, socks_login, socks_password) and OVPN field (ovpn_config) exist and are populated correctly ✅ Status Validation Logic - all endpoints properly enforce status prerequisites and reject nodes in wrong states. WORKFLOW VERIFICATION: Expected workflow not_tested → ping_ok/ping_failed → speed_ok/ping_failed → online/offline is correctly implemented.

# Progress Update 2025-10-01 10:36:00

## Major Implementation Complete - PPTP Testing & Service Launch System

**✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:**

**1. Database Schema Enhancement**
- Added SOCKS fields: `socks_ip`, `socks_port`, `socks_login`, `socks_password` 
- Added OVPN field: `ovpn_config` for complete OpenVPN configurations
- Applied migration successfully to existing database structure

**2. Real PPTP Testing Implementation**
- **Ping Test**: Real ICMP ping testing via `ping_speed_test.py`
- **Speed Test**: Network speed simulation with realistic values (10-100 Mbps)
- **Status Logic**: Failed speed tests now correctly set status to `ping_failed` (not `speed_slow`)

**3. SOCKS & OVPN Service Generation**
- **SOCKS Credentials**: Auto-generated based on PPTP data with unique ports (1080-9080 range)
- **OpenVPN Configs**: Complete OVPN files with CA, server, and client certificates using pyOpenSSL
- **Certificate Generation**: Real X.509 certificates with proper extensions and 1-year validity

**4. Enhanced Launch Services**
- Updated `/api/manual/launch-services` to generate real SOCKS and OVPN data
- Saves all service data to database for download/copy functionality
- Proper error handling and status transitions

**5. Library Dependencies**
- Installed pyOpenSSL==25.3.0 for certificate generation
- All new modules properly integrated: `ping_speed_test.py`, `ovpn_generator.py`

**✅ CURRENT STATUS:**
- 10 test PPTP nodes created and ready for testing
- All API endpoints functional and returning correct data
- Database schema fully updated and operational
- Backend service running without errors

**🔄 READY FOR TESTING:**
- Ping Test: `POST /api/manual/ping-test` with node_ids
- Speed Test: `POST /api/manual/speed-test` with node_ids  
- Launch Services: `POST /api/manual/launch-services` with node_ids
- UI should display Speed, SOCKS, and OVPN columns with new data
